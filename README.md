# Data_Science_with_Python
Hands-on notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning (classification, regression, clustering) with scikit-learn, plus model selection via GridSearchCV. (All projects built with Python: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, scikit-learn; includes web scraping, SQL, PCA, and recommender systems.)  

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks I developed while practicing **Data Science with Python**.  
It includes hands-on work with Python libraries such as **NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn**.

Each notebook focuses on a key concept of the data science process â€” from data cleaning and visualization to machine learning models and evaluation.

### Topics covered:
- Python for Data Science  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Wrangling and Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Linear and Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Trees and Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Clustering (K-Means)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Recommender Systems  
- Model Optimization with GridSearchCV

### Tools & Libraries
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“„ About this Repository

This project demonstrates my practical experience in **Data Science and Machine Learning using Python**,  
as listed in my rÃ©sumÃ© (skills: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, data visualization, model evaluation, GridSearchCV).

It shows my ability to:
- Work with real datasets  
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Train, tune, and evaluate machine learning models  
- Visualize and interpret results
